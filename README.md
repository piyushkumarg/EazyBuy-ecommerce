# EazyBuy - ecommerce

The EazyBuy e-commerce project consists of a frontend and a backend component. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for both customers and admins to browse and purchase products. The admin has accessibility to update, delete, and manage orders of the products. Additionally, the backend handles server-side functionalities such as authentication, data storage, and order management.
